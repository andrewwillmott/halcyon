CHANGES
		
1.0.2
	fixed SByte typo
	added Short
	fixed EltArray bug: calling memcpy with item = 0	

1.0.1
	Applied fix from max for DblList nukes
	Fix from dushyanth to make env handling better
		
	Would you believe the C++ "standard" has changed so that new no longer
	returns 0 on out of memory? It now throws an exception. Jeez, Bjarne,
	what happened to all that "no overhead for language features you don't
	use" crap? 
	Nuked all asserts on new returning zero.

	fixed bugs in Array code: need to compare copied arrays to items, not
	allocated, as allocated can be zero if the array doesn't own its data.
		
	added String().Printf()
	added FindFileExtension to FileName

	fixed bug in Array::Replace which caused problems when the source
	array was subsequently resized.
	added Array::Append for arrays. (never needed this before!)

	added NArray so we're not always re-instantiating code for each new
	type of array. (Long overdue!) Still use Array code for basic types.

	added Heap code for priority queue stuff.
	added cycle counter for pentiums
